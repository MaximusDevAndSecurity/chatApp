I made this app for a school project. Its main purpose is to demonstrate:
How you can build a web application that authenticates with sensitive user information like passwords while also storing them securely in a database with hashing and utilizing user-friendly features like cookies
(Made by beginner)

users that already exist in database:

Username: admin
Password: admin123

Username: star-lord
Password: starlord123
